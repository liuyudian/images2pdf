images2pdf
----------

Qt/Ruby application to merge all images from directory to single pdf.
- uses/requires qtruby and prawn
- places one image per page
- fits image to page size (A4)

Todo and possible improvements (read as 'missing features'):
- page and image size could be specified by user?
- it could do (optionaly) some optimizations of images (resize them using rmagick before adding to pdf for ex.)
- better readme and installation/deployment description
- image2pdf processing code is now separate from qt gui but for price of gui freezes
- - (uses callback communication)
- - could be placed in separate thread/background job etc
- - this logic could be extremely easily wrapped up in CLI interface
